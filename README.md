# weather-application

Hi i'm Mohith , this my second project .
I have created a weather application using Html5, Css , JavaScript using OpenWeather API.
AIM: To help people or user know the current weather of the location they desire, wheather it's gonna be storm or sunny etc.. so that they can plan accordingly .

Features: The weather application has search bar with search icon , it shows the temperature,humidity,wind speed, weather description with a small image showing sun or cloud with rain
